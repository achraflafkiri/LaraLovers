__2-2 In Laravel, there are several types or kinds of controllers that you can use depending on your application's needs. Here are some of the most common types:__

### Resource Controllers

* php artisan make:controller

* CRUD system

### API Controllers

* php artisan make:controller --api

* CRUD system

* return JSON responses

### Controller Middleware (type of middleware)

applied to a specific controller or group of controllers
allowed to perform something (actions) before the controller method is executed
You can define controller middleware in the ____construct()__ method of your controller

### Invokable Controllers
allows you to define a __single method__

    php artisan make:controller --invokable 

#### Controller Traits

Controller traits are a way to reuse common controller logic across multiple controllers. You can define a trait that contains methods for things like handling form input or handling errors, and then include that trait in your other controllers. To create a controller trait, simply create a PHP file in your app/Http/Controllers/Traits directory.

#### Controller Namespacing
Controller Namespacing: Controller namespacing is a way to organize your controllers into separate namespaces based on your application's logic. For example, you might have a Admin namespace for controllers that are only accessible by administrators. To create a namespaced controller, simply create a directory with the same name as your namespace in your app/Http/Controllers directory, and then place your controller file inside that directory.
